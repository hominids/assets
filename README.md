The community is open to changes for all logos and icons.

### 员 - What's this?
The 员 symbol is the Chinese character for "person" or "member". The use of this symbol within the Hominid project is currently undecided. In the future, it may be offered up as a decentralized top-level domain for individual users, and/or it may be the symbol for a dedicated token. The ownership of the 员 domain on Handshake currently belongs to a private entity.
